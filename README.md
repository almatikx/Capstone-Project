Identify the issue: Our Continuum robot is inflexible but very rigid. 
When we control it with our mechanism, the movement operation looks very slow, 
insufficient, imperfect and inflexible. And also we need to increase its lifting capacity. 
We also need to design a gripper that can lift objects weighing 1-2 kg.
