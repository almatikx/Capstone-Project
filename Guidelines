Project Management tool is Trello. 

Identify the issue: Our Continuum robot is inflexible but very rigid. 
When we control it with our mechanism, the movement operation looks very slow, 
insufficient, imperfect and inflexible. And also we need to increase its lifting capacity. 
We also need to design a gripper that can lift objects weighing 1-2 kg.

We do not quite understand the fundamental control of Continuum. 
2 years ago, my friend and I decided to design a manipulator with stepper motors.
As a result, we failed due to lack of knowledge about the design principles of manipulators. 
Because in this case, we do not have a clear idea of ​​​​how to design a proper Continuum robot. 
That is why this study. We need knowledge about pulley mechanisms, rigidity, spring with motor control and so on. 
We need to test many times until graduation day.
